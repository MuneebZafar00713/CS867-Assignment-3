# CS867-Assignment-3
Image Classification Using CNN

## Pretained Model weights
Download vgg16_transfer_trained_wts.h5 file (found in main branch)
Upload same file in Assignment 3.ipynb co-lab

## Replicate Results
1. Open Assignment 3.ipynb in co-lab
2. Upload intel-image-classification.zip (https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification/version/2) to google-drive
3. Unzip intel-image-classification.zip in co-lab (make sure zip file includes labelled test data as well)
4. Run all cells upto ###### Model Training (Model Fitting)
5. Skip model training and graph visualization cells
6. Directly run cell ###### Load Model Weights (If Required) to load pre-trained weights
7. Run all cells below to reproduce all results
